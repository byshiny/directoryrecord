I want to program this program in C, so that's it's portable to Linux and also in mac.
The way I'm going to do this, is to listen to ./bashrc_history, and look for any changes.
From there, I'm going to keep a running list of directory history.

The interface will look like this:

dr - list all the history of a directory with the earliest directory
starting at one and going backwards to let's say a limit of 1000 lines.
dr 5 - would go back 5 directories.
dr purge - remove the file stores the directory

hmm.. Suppose:

6 - A
5 - B
4 - C
3 - D
2 - E
1 - F


User goes back to D

7 - A
6 - B
5 - C
4 - D
3 - E
2 - F
1 - D

Problem: The numbers keep changing, because it's a stack that keeps being re-ordered.
Eh. Let's shelve this for now, and improve on it later.

How should I be storing the information? Should it be json? Do I again, need to use a circular buffer?
